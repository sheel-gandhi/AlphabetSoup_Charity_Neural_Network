# AlphabetSoup_Charity_Neural_Network

Alphabet Soup Charity using Neural Network

## Purpose

Alphabet Soup Charity, a charity organization is about to analyse 34,000 fundings to predict whether it was successful or not. There are multiple features like - APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT on which success of funding is predicted. We shall be using Keras module from TensorFlow to run Neural Network

## Overview

* **Compare the differences between the traditional machine learning classification and regression models and the neural network models.**
* **Describe the perceptron model and its components.**
* **Implement neural network models using TensorFlow.**
* **Explain how different neural network structures change algorithm performance.**
* **Preprocess and construct datasets for neural network models.**
* **Compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks.**
* **Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow.**
* **Save trained TensorFlow models for later use.**
